# FYS website project
This repository will contain everything you need to do the final project for
CICS 191FY1: History of Computing. Right now, only part 1 is up. Some ideas for
part 2 will be up shortly so keep checking back!

## Getting started
Click the green "Code" button in the top left of this page, then click
"Download ZIP" to get all the files for this project.

## Part 1
In part 1, you will adapt index.html and style.css to make your very own
portfolio website. These files have lots of comments that explain what every
line does.

To get full credit for this part, you need to do the following:
 - change the title of the document to something sensible
 - update the header to display your name
 - fill in the "About me" section with information about yourself
 - fill in the "Projects" section with a few projects you have done (school
   projects are fine)
 - add a new section other than the photography section and add content that
   showcases something interesting about you
 - add a working link in the navbar to your new section
 - pick a new font from Google Fonts and update the stylesheet to use it
 - change the color scheme of the entire site to something a little prettier
   (links, background color, text)

Each of these tasks is worth 0.25 points towards your grade for this project.
There are 2 points total to earn in part 1, and the other 2 points will come
from part 2, for 4 points total.

If you already have an existing website that you would like to use, you will
need to adapt it so that it follows the guidelines above. So:
 - It should have a title.
 - It should feature your name prominently somewhere.
 - It should have an "About me" section with information about yourself.
 - It should have a "Projects" section with a few projects you've done.
 - It should have some other sections.
 - It should have a navbar with links that take you to each section.
 - It should load and use a font from Google Fonts.
 - It should have a non-default color scheme.

## Part 2
Coming soon...
