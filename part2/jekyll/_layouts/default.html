This is an HTML file. HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language." It is the
format that all the websites you visit are written in.

Any modern browser will allow you to view the HTML source code of any website.
In Google Chrome, you can do this by right-clicking on a page and clicking the
"View page source" button in the menu that appears. You can also click the
"Inspect" button to open the Developer Console, then click the "Elements" tab
to get a nicer, more interactive view of the page's code. (And many other
things! Try poking around.)

Everything between the two arrow-like symbols surrounding this text is a
comment. Go through this file and follow the instructions in the comments to
make your own portfolio page!

<!--
Technically, all HTML documents must start with a doctype declaration, as
written below. If you forget to include this, your browser probably won't mind
though.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now, we will begin our HTML document using the <html> tag.
-->
<html>
    <!--
    Now we will create the "head" of our document. All HTML documents have a
    "head," where we set up the page by setting metadata, loading scripts and
    stylesheets, and anything else we might need to do. The "body" has the
    action content.

    In LaTeX terms, an HTML document's head is like a LaTeX document's preamble
    and an HTML document's body is like a LaTeX document's "document"
    environment.
    -->
    <head>
        <!--
        First, we will set the title of your page. This is the text that appears
        in your browser as the label for a tab.
        -->
        <title>Sam's Website</title>

        <!--
        Next, we will load in a stylesheet. Stylesheets are written in a
        language called CSS (Cascading StyleSheets). You will look at the
        stylesheet once you are done with this file.

        You _could_ do your styling right here in this HTML document, by using
        the <style> tag or by setting style attributes for individual elements.
        However this is generally considered to be bad practice.
        --><link rel="stylesheet" href= "project2.css"/>
		</head>



    <!--
    Now we will move on to the body of the document. As a reminder, this will
    contain all of the actual content of your page.
    -->
    <body>
        <!--
        A "div" element specifies a division of your HTML document. It can be
        used for grouping together things that should belong with one another.
        This is useful for applying some style change to only _part_ of your
        document. For example, if you want to have blog posts in black text and
        alerts in red text, you could wrap up both in divs and apply those
        styles to each seperately.

        A div can have an "id" or a "class", which is a name associated with a
        div that allows stylesheets and scripts to find it. There can only be
        one div with a certain id, but there is no limit on the number of divs
        that can have some class. You might use an id for a navigation bar (of
        which there should only be one) and a class for an element on the
        navigation bar (of which there will be many).

        We will now create a div with id "container." The container will contain
        all of our content while keeping it seperate from the body overall.
        -->
        <div id="container">
            <!--
            Let's make another div, for the header. This section will feature
            your name, and some handy links.
            
            Later, we will make other divs for the content and the footer.
            -->
            <div id="header">
                <!--
                First, since you are making a portfolio website you will want to
                feature your own name prominently. We will use a <span>, which
                is similar to a <div> but is typically used for smaller amounts
                of the document.
                -->
                <span id="name">Sam Rogers</span>

                <!--
                To divide this content from the rest of the page, we will use a
                horizontal line, which can be drawn using the hr tag.
                -->
                <hr />

                <!--
                Now let's put some links in! These will be "anchor" links that
                make your browser scroll to a different section of the page,
                instead of taking you to a whole new page. A link uses the tag
                <a> and has an attribute called "href" that specifies where the
                link takes you. You can tell an anchor link from a regular link
                because it starts with a # character.

                We will use the <ul> (unordered list) environment and fill it
                with <li>s (list items). By default this produces a bullet list,
                but with some CSS styling we can convert it into something that
                looks a bit more like a navigation bar. Crucially since we apply
                those styles selectively we can still use the regular old bullet
                style <ul> anywhere else in the document!
                -->
                <ul id="navbar">
                    <li><a href="#about-me-section">About me</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#projects-section">Projects</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#favorite-movies-section">Favorite Movies</a></li>
                </ul>

                <!--
                One more horizontal line...
                -->
                <hr />

                <!--
                And that's the end of our header!
                -->
            </div>

            <!--
            Now we need to add the content of our page. We will need another div
            for this.
            -->
            <div id="content">
                <!--
                The content area will have sections corresponding to the links
                we added to the navbar. Clicking on one of the links will take
                you to that section on the page.

                Since we're now going to have more than one of the same kind of
                thing (sections), it's appropriate to start using classes.

                HTML has a "section" tag, but it doesn't actually do anything so
                we will still need to style it using CSS. Each section will have
                both a class "content-section" so we can apply rules to _all_
                sections, as well as a unique ID so that our anchor links work.
                -->
                <section class="content-section" id="about-me-section">

                    This section shows how to create tables. This is an _okay_
                    way of doing complicated formatting. Ideally you would use
                    CSS grids or flexboxes or use a library like Bootstrap that
                    does it for you, but this is fine for now as a beginner
                    project.

                    <tr> means "table row" and <td> means "table data cell
                    element" (basically, one entry in the table).

                    An <img> tag loads an image. If you have images you'd like
                    to include without posting them on the web, you can just
                    put them in the same folder as this file then put their name
                    directly as the value for the src attribute.

                    It is generally considered rude to embed images from other
                    sites since it can eat up a lot of their bandwidth, but
                    since this is such a small class I don't think Wikimedia
                    will mind.
